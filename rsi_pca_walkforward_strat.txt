1. clean and format data to datetime
2. Calculate rsi for periods 2-20 using calculate_rsi() function in functions.py. Output dataframe of all rsis indexed by date. 
3. Plot heatmap of correlations:
    Ideally want low correlations between lookback periods to ensure components in PCA are uncorrelated. If lookback periods are highly correlated this could mean 
    that the periods carry simialr information and are not adding much value to the model individually. Want to identify which periods give the most distinct 
    signals. 
4. conduct_pca() function: Standardize RSI columns, from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, from sklearn.decomposition import PCA, apply PCA and store 
    PCs into a df, calc and return the explained variance ratio for each PC. 
5. create a linear combination of weights for the first two PCs and a combined PC column in the pca_df. 
6. use the walk_forward_pca() function to iterate through training and test data using the strategy: buy when combined pca is > 0 AND RSI < 30, sell when combined 
    pca < 0 AND RSI > 70. Determine what proportion of the test signals were correct when compared to the actual historical price differences.
